# CSVideoNet

0.25_196_ExtractFrame.sh is used to extract frames from videos.
generateTrainCNN.m is used to generate image blocks for training CNN1(Background CNN).
/caffe/model/crX contains all the necessary file for training CNN1.

extractFeatures_5_25.m is used to extract the intermediate feature extracted by CNN1. 

/model contains all the files for training the whole framework. The intermediate feature captured by CNN is used as input for CNN1, the pre-trained CNN1 is further trained with the whole framework. The original image blocks is the input for CNN2, CNN2 is trained from scratch.
